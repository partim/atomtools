		     Atom Extensions for Socializing (Asoc)

Abstract

   This document defines a number of extension to the Atom Syndication
   Format and the Atom Publishing Protocol to make them available for short
   messages.


1.  Introduction

   The Atom Syndication Format and its editing protocol, the Atom
   Publishing Protocol, have originally been designed with larger
   articles in mind.  However, their principle concepts make them very
   suitable as a basis for the social networks.  This documents defines
   a set of extensions that will allow using Atom and Atompub for this
   purpose.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   
3.  Atom Extensions

   This document defines new elements for use in Atom and Atompub
   documents. These are to be considered foreign markup as defined in
   section 6 of [RFC4287]. 

   The XML namespace name [REC-xml-names] for all these elements is:

      http://www.alipedis.com/2012/asoc

   This specification uses the prefix "asoc:" for the namespace name. The
   prefix "atom:" is used for "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom", the namespace
   name of the Atom Syndication Format [RFC4287]. The prefix "app:" is
   used for "http://www.w3.org/2007/app", the namespace name for the Atom
   Publishing Protocol [RFC5023].

   Like Atom itself, this document does not define a DTD.

3.1.  Asoc Documents

   Besides reusing documents defined both by Atom and Atompub, this
   specification describes several XML documents of its own for various
   purposes.

      namespace asoc = "http://www.alipedis.com/2012/asoc"
      start = asocPost | asocPeer | asocPeers | asocCertifcate
            | asocCertificates

   All of these documents use the media type "application/asoc+xml".

3.2.  Element Definitions

3.2.1.  The "ames:post" Element

   The "ames:post" element represents an individual short message. It
   essentially is a light-weight sibling of the "atom:entry" element in
   that it contains a subset of the same elements as an "atom:entry".

   The "ames:post" element can appear as a child of an "atom:feed" element
   instead of the normal "atom:entry" elements or it can appear as the
   document element of a stand-alone AMes Post Document

   amesPost =
      element ames:post {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         (atomAuthor*
          & atomCategory*
          & amesContent
          & atomId
          & atomLink*
          & atomPublished?
          & atomRights?
          & atomUpdated
          & extensionElement*)
      }

   This specification assigns no significance to the order of appearance
   of the child elements of atom:entry.

   The following child elements are defined by this specification (note
   that it requires the presence of some of these elements):

   o  ames:post elements MUST contain one or more atom:author elements,
      unless the ames:post element contains an atom:source element that
      contains an atom:author element or, in an Atom Feed Document, the
      atom:feed element contains an atom:author element itself.
   o  ames:post elements MAY contain any number of atom:category elements.
   o  ames:post elements MUST contain exactly one ames:content element.
   o  ames:post elements MUST contain exactly one atom:id element.
   o  ames:post elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:link
      element with a rel attribute value of "alternate" that has the
      same combination of type and hreflang attribute values.
   o  ames:post elements MAY contain additional atom:link elements beyond
      those described above.
   o  ames:post element MUST NOT contain more than one atom:rights element.
   o  ames:post elements MUST contain exactly one atom:updated element.

3.2.2.  The "ames:content" Element

   The "ames:content" element contains the content of the post. Unlike
   atom:content, it is limited to directly contain textual content and thus
   is a Text construct as defined in Section 3.1. of [RFC4287].

   amesContent = element ames:content { atomTextConstruct }
